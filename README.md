A python command line interface to create ascii art from a given file. 
Todos:
-Map ascii chars to brightnesses so that we can get a more grayscale image (instead of just pure black or pure white)
-Add support for file types other than .jpg
-Add flag to optionally generate html file instead of text (with white on black and such)
