A python command line interface to create ascii art from a given file. 

Todos:

-Map ascii chars to brightnesses so that we can get a more grayscale img (instead of black/white)

-Add options for final dimensions

-Add better method to lower quality of image (should probably default to 200x200)

-Add flag to optionally generate html file instead of text
